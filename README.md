# Awesome D [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
---

  A curated list of awesome D frameworks, libraries and software. Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).
  
  I created this list so that when I needed something in the future, it would be easy to find. Most of the documents and links are collected from the [D forum](https://forum.dlang.org), the [D wiki](https://wiki.dlang.org), and the [D package repository](https://code.dlang.org). Exploring GitHub also helps as many of the libs are hosted there.
  
  If you know an interesting lib/app in D, please tell us through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dlang-community/awesome-d/issues) or [edit this file](https://github.com/dlang-community/awesome-d/edit/master/README.md).

## GUI Libs
*Libraries for working with graphical user interface applications.*

* [DLangUI](https://github.com/buggins/dlangui) - Cross Platform GUI for D programming language. My personal favorate, because it is written in D(not a binding), and is cross platform. DLangUI also has a good showcase in the IDE [DLangIDE](https://github.com/buggins/dlangide).
* [GtkD](https://github.com/gtkd-developers/GtkD) - GtkD is a D binding and OO wrapper of GTK+. GtkD is actively maintained and is currently the most stable GUI lib for D.
* [DWT](https://github.com/d-widget-toolkit/dwt) - A library for creating cross-platform GUI applications. GWT is a port of the Java SWT library to D. DWT was promoted as a semi-standard GUI library for D, but unfortunately didn't catch up popularity yet.
* [tkD](https://github.com/nomad-software/tkd) - GUI toolkit for the D programming language based on Tcl/Tk.
* [dqml](https://github.com/filcuc/dqml) -  Qt Qml bindings for the D programming language.
* [Sciter-Dport](https://github.com/sciter-sdk/Sciter-Dport) - D bindings for the [Sciter](https://sciter.com) - crossplatform HTML/CSS/script desktop UI toolkit.
* [LibUI](https://github.com/Extrawurst/DerelictLibui) - Dynamic Binding for [libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui)

*Note*: You can also find a list of GUI libs on [wiki.dlang.org](https://wiki.dlang.org/Libraries_and_Frameworks#GUI_Libraries), but not all of the libraries are actively maintained now.
